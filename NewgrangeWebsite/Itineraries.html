        <h1> Itineraries </h1>
        <p> We know that many people love to plan their visits. Therefore, there are some places worth a visit in Drogheda.</p>
        <h2> Highlanes Municipal Art Gallery (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Don’t judge a book by its cover – Highlanes Municipal Art Gallery might not look like a modern gallery if you look for its outside. The gallery is sited in the former Drogheda Franciscan Church which was called the “High lane Church”. This gallery has been working hard on education and local art, therefore, it is necessary that we show our support through visiting and donation so as to help the gallery to reach its goal of long-term development.

            Visit the website:

        </p>


        <h2> Battle of the Boyne Visitor Centre(up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> It is never easy to protect your lands without any battle in history. This visitor centre can give you a fascinating insight into battles since 1690 around the area. The centre also provides high- quality refreshments at the Tearoom Pavilion, visitors can enjoy food inside the building or in the outdoor area under the sun. This site will satisfy you with great knowledge as well as delicacy.

        </p>


        <h2> St Peter's Church (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> This church is one of the landmarks in Drogheda that has typical features of Gothic buildings. Every window, status and door is artistic and well-designed. If you visit Drogheda, you have no excuse for not visiting it.

        </p>


        <h2> St Laurence Gate (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> St Laurence’s Gate is regarded as one of the finest of its kind in Europe. The mediaeval wall and its structure provide a great historical vibe to visitors, therefore, we encourage visitors to explore this place, especially since this church is close to many tourist spots in Drogheda.

        </p>


        <h2> Magdalene Tower (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Magdalene Tower is one of the important heritage sites of Dominican Friary founded in about 1224. This tower has been going through a lot of history and was damaged by Cromwell’s cannon during the siege of 1649. History is always an important part of our life, so this tower should be listed on your list to go.

        </p>


        <h2> Drogheda Museum Millmount (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> This site is reputed to be 3000 years old. However, it was damaged during the Irish Civil War in 1922. After that, this tower was restored in 2000. What makes this tower unique is that it is now run as a community museum.

        <h2> Monasterboice Monastic Site (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Monasterboice is a monastic site with a round tower founded in the 600s. Religion has been changing, and the important role of this site was replaced by the Mellifront Abbey in 1142. Battle, wars and religious replacement of this site really give us a great insight into the history and hopefully, we can learn some lessons from visiting this site.

        </p>

        <h2> Mellifont Abbey (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Mellifont Abbey was founded in 1142 to train monks until monasteries were suppressed by King Henry VIII in 1539 and the Mellifont Abbey was ruined since then. This site is a sign of belief and it will be a good place to visit. If you are on your car trip, you will only need to drive 15 minutes from Newgrange to this place.

        <h2> Beaulieu House and Gardens (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Beaulieu is an ancient estate adjacent to the town of Drogheda and it has been built over 800 years as a home to two families, the Plunketts and the Tichbournes. It is interesting that this estate was inherited by the female line of the families. This is very unique back in the days in the 18th century.

        <h2> Hill of Slane (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> The Hill of Slane has many historic sites on it and it has been chosen as the site of Christian abbey to have missionary work on this area because of Patrick’s devotion. Legend has it that this hill suffered from a fire because of the contest between a Christian missionary and native Irish pagans in 433 CE. There were a lot of stories that happened in this area and we should not miss any of them.

        <h2> Slane Castle (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> Slane Castle is one of the most fascinating buildings in Ireland because of its construction. This building was built in 1703, however, there is often fire when it comes to the preservation of heritage. In 1991, a fire in the castle damaged the building badly and it reopened in 2001 after a serious restoration.

        <h2> Listoke Distillery & Gin School (up and down arrow button)</h2>
        <p> It would be a stereotype to think that Drogheda is only an old traditional and historical place when this place is full of lively and energetic people. Listoke Distillery & Gin School is the first gin school in Ireland, and it is an important role in local business and revitalization. This school is never left behind the trend. When COVID-19 spread all over the state causing a lack of hand sanitizers, this school started producing their alcoholic sanitizers to help its business and society. Therefore, why not visit this gin school when things become normal?
